A vector is a 1 dimensioanl array of numbers

Feature vector is something that represents features of some object.

Example of data representations

1. If I have image how do i represent as a 1 dimnesional vector idea is to convert black and white to 0 and 1 and other colors between 0 and 255
2. If we have a paragragh how to represent - for eg count how many times the para has a word dog and form a vector
